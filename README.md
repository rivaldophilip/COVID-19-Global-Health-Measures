# COVID-19-Global-Health-Measures
Lockdown policies have been cited to help curb the outbreak of COVID-19. However, existing claims have not analyzed these policies on a global basis, neglecting the fact that it may only work on a small number of cases. Cultural influences are rarely studied, despite its importance in affecting public health outcomes. 

The study aims to investigate the role of culture in influencing the effectiveness of countermeasures against the novel coronavirus crisis globally. The study analyzes the effect of policy stringency in reducing mortality rate in 124 countries through panel data analysis with fixed, time, two-way, and interactive effects. The author uses three model iterations: starting with a benchmark of policy stringency and mortality rate, adding cultural variables, and controlling for other healthy, economic, and demographic variables. 

The models were able to find some significance in increasing the stringency of policies to reduce mortality rate. From here, the author also found that trust variables are more significant in affecting mortality outcomes compared to other cultural variables. Nevertheless, the result of model performances and further investigation on the models highlight the existence of omitted variables. This indicates that currently there is insufficient data to firmly establish a relationship between policies, culture, and COVID-19 mortality rate.
